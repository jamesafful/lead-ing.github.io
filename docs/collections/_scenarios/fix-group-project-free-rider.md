**Private message (start calm):**  
“Hey, can we sync for 10 minutes today? I want to make sure we’re both clear on who’s doing what.”

**Alignment conversation (3 steps):**
1) **Facts:** “We planned X by Friday. I didn’t see it yet.”  
2) **Impact:** “When that slips, we can’t finish Y, and I’m up late.”  
3) **Ask:** “Can you take A by Wednesday 5pm, or should we swap tasks?”

**If they agree but slip again:**  
“Looks like A didn’t happen. What’s the blocker? I can split it with you today, but we need it done to ship.”

**If they refuse:**  
“I can’t carry both roles. If we can’t split this fairly, I’ll loop in Ms. Taylor to reassign parts.”

**Try this today:** Write and send the first DM now.
