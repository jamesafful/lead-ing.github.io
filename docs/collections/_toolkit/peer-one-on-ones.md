**Format (15 minutes):**
- 3 min — Wins since last time
- 6 min — What’s stuck / how I can help
- 3 min — What I’ll do by next time
- 3 min — Feedback both ways (“What should I keep doing? Start? Stop?”)

**DM script to set it up:**  
“Hey! Want to do a 15‑min check‑in every Tuesday for the next 4 weeks? I think it’ll make our project faster + less stressful.”

**Template:** Make a shared doc with three headings: *Wins, Stuck, Next.*

**Try this today:** Book the first one for next week; send the DM now.
