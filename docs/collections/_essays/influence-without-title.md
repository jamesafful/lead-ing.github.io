Leadership without a title runs on **credibility**: *say → do → show → repeat.*

- **Say** what you’ll do (short, specific, dated)
- **Do** it on time (or renegotiate early)
- **Show** the result (post the link, the doc, the clip)
- **Repeat** (people start trusting your word)

Add two boosters: **be kind** (public credit, private feedback) and **be clear** (one owner per task). That’s it.
