**Day 1–2:** Meet people 1:1 (10–15 min). Ask: *What’s working? What’s broken? What would “great” look like in 4 weeks?*  
**Day 3–4:** Write a 1‑page plan: goals, 3 priorities, who owns what, next checkpoint date.  
**Day 5–7:** Ship one small win. Post proof.  
**Week 2:** Establish the 30‑minute meeting, schedule peer 1:1s, set norms for the group chat.
