**When to use it:** You need to align a group and leave with clear owners and next steps.

**Goal:** Everyone knows the decision, the owners, and the deadlines—no follow‑up confusion.

## The script
1. **Kickoff (2 min)** — “Goal today is __. Success looks like __. We’ll end with owners and dates.”
2. **Updates (8 min)** — Round‑robin: *What did you do? What’s blocked? What’s next?*
3. **Decisions (15 min)** — Tackle the 1–2 biggest choices. Timebox: 7 minutes each.
4. **Wrap (5 min)** — “Owners: __ by __. Risks: __. Next check‑in: __.”

## Checklist
- Agenda sent before the meeting
- Roles assigned (Facilitator, Scribe, Timekeeper)
- Timer visible
- Decision and owners written live

## Pitfalls
- Too many topics → pick 1–2
- No owner → nothing happens
- Vague next steps → dates or it didn’t happen

## Try this today
Copy this into your next invite and run it exactly once. Adjust after.
